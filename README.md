## The York University Computer Science Primer

### About
My love letter and graduation gift to York University &mdash; a guide to York University's Computer Science program.
This is intended to document all the things I've learned over the years, answers to commonly asked questions, and
bequeath all the things I wish I knew sooner.

### Contributing
Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/chrisngyn/york-cs-primer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
Essentially, I'll be posting GitHub issues about things I want added (e.g. missing course descriptions, UI updates, etc.)
and those are free to work on. If there's something not listed that you want to see added, open an issue.
