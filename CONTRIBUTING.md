## Contributing
Thank you for contributing to the project! While I can't guarantee your pull request
will be merged, I'm open to reviewing any changes that might improve the website.

### What can I work on?
Most things I need help for (e.g. course descriptions) will be posted in the
[issues board](https://github.com/chrisngyn/york-cs-primer/issues). If there's
something you think is worth adding and it's not on the board, open an issue!

One thing I feel that would crop up often is courses changing from when I took them.
If you've taken a course that's radically different from when I took it, you should
open an issue to let me know!

Also, considering the only time I work on this website is really late at night, I'm
certain it's riddled with grammar errors everywhere. Feel free to ping me if you see
there needs to be a correction somewhere.
